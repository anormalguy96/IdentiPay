## IdentiPay – Face Identification Based Fare Payment System

IdentiPay is a prototype project that explores how face recognition technology can be applied to Baku Metro’s public transportation fare system. Instead of using cards or cash, passengers’ faces act as their ticket, making the payment process faster, more secure, and more convenient.

## Project Overview

* **Goal is** replacing traditional fare payment methods with an automated face identification system.
* **Scope ** Demonstrates how computer vision and machine learning can be integrated into a real-world payment infrastructure.
* **It has been inspired by** public transport systems in cities worldwide, just like Japan, and IdentiPay shows how Azerbaijan could adopt a similar approach.

# Lovable Website using This Notebook
You can also check out [IdentiPay's website](https://identipay-app.lovable.app) in order to experience it live. Even though there are some minor issues, we have managed to handle the core stack.

## Future Directions

* Expand the dataset (perhaps utilising a wider one) to improve recognition accuracy.
* Integrate with real-world transport turnstile systems.
* Add privacy and security layers to protect user data.
* Explore scaling for nationwide public transportation.
